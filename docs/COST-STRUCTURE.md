# Cost Structure

RENTROPY runs an **asset-light marketplace** model (like Airbnb): we connect people who have gear with people who need it. We don’t own the inventory, so we avoid the heaviest costs of traditional rental businesses. Our cost structure is built around **platform**, **marketing**, and **support**.

---

## 1. Platform management

Costs to build, run, and improve the digital product and infrastructure.

- **Product & engineering** — Design, development, and testing of the app (listings, search, filters, date-based pricing, chat, dashboards, payments).
- **Infrastructure & hosting** — Domains, hosting, CDN, databases, and third-party services (auth, payments, email, analytics).
- **Security & compliance** — Data protection, secure checkout, and meeting local regulations.
- **Maintenance & reliability** — Bug fixes, performance, uptime, and technical debt.

---

## 2. Marketing and promotion

Costs to acquire and retain both sides of the marketplace: **lenders** (supply) and **renters** (demand).

- **Brand & awareness** — Brand identity, content, and campaigns that promote “rent over buy” and the circular economy.
- **Renter acquisition** — Paid and organic channels (search, social, partnerships) to bring in people who want to rent.
- **Lender acquisition** — Incentives, referrals, and outreach to bring in people who list gear and tools.
- **Retention & engagement** — Email, in-app messaging, and programs to keep users active and repeat-renting.

---

## 3. Support (host, lender & renter)

Costs to help users succeed and stay safe on the platform.

- **Customer support** — Help for renters and lenders (bookings, issues, returns, questions).
- **Trust & safety** — Verification, reviews, dispute handling, and policies that keep the marketplace safe and fair.
- **Payments & payouts** — Processing payments, payouts to lenders, refunds, and related fraud prevention.
- **Insurance & protection** — Optional coverage (e.g. damage/loss protection) to reduce risk for both sides; Host Guarantee–style products if offered.

## Why this structure

| Traditional rental business       | RENTROPY (Airbnb-style)           |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Owns or holds inventory          | Marketplace only; lenders own gear |
| Logistics, warehousing, delivery | Handled by lenders/partners       |
| Cleaning, repairs, maintenance   | Lenders’ responsibility           |
| High fixed costs                 | Focus on platform + growth + support |

By not owning inventory or doing fulfilment ourselves, we keep the cost structure **light** and scalable: the main levers are **platform management**, **marketing and promotion**, and **support**.

*This mirrors an Airbnb-style cost structure and can be updated as RENTROPY adds new products (e.g. delivery partners, subscription tiers, or expanded protection).*
